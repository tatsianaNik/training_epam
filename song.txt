Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park
Then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix

And I watched it count down till the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
